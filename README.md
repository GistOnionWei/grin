# Libercoin Quark

Libercoin is implementation of the MimbleWimble protocol. Many characteristics are still undefined but the following constitutes a first set of choices:

  * Clean and minimal implementation, and aiming to stay as such.
  * Follows the MimbleWimble protocol, which provides great anonymity and scaling characteristics.
  * Cuckoo Cycle proof of work in two variants named Cuckaroo (ASIC-resistant) and Cuckatoo (ASIC-targeted).
  * Relatively fast block time: one minute.
  * Transaction fees are based on the number of Outputs created/destroyed and total transaction size.
  * Smooth curve for difficulty adjustments.
